Reploy
=======

Testing Github repo deployment.

# To Do

* Encryption for FTP data.
* Installation script.
* FTP through php has been proofed but a functionality needs to be written to do the following:
    * Get changes from Github
    * Replace updated files and folders
    * Deleted removed files and folders
    * Full redeploy
* Better relationships between users and repos.
    * Best would be if a user adds a repo already added by another user they get added as a member of that on the system. They can then see other users deployments for that repo.
